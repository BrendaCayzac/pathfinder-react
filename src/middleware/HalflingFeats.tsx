        While sharing a creature’s space using Dance Underfoot, your weapons and
        unarmed attacks gain the trip trait, but only against the creature whose
        space you share. You can be in the same space as a Large or larger prone
        creature, even if it’s not your ally.

        notice so thoroughly you appear to be somewhere else. You become
        invisible for 1 minute or until you take a hostile action, whichever
        comes first. Choose a location within 10 feet of you. Until your
        invisibility ends, you appear to be hidden in that location to anyone
